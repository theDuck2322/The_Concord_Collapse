Done:
- make a drawcall counter (create your draw function that uses opengl draw function 
			but which increases a counter and u reset it at the end) 
			some global context stuff
- make some debug renderer for physics engine
- Relative path at runtime
- if u think and are in mood, make some abstractions for that physics engine
- if u want to add ImGUI, these conditions must be passed:
		- make the debug renderer
		- use docking
		- have strong reasons to add ImGUI to the project
- make a player maybe

left to do:
-work to the first level of the game
